Analysis code for the 2018 muon inter-depth calibration for HE within tracker coverage (18<ieta<27)

NtuplerReader: make basic selections and fill tree for fitting (one muon per entry)

AnalysisTools: make fits, extract MVP values, pileup correction based on number of vertices, make MVP/layer vs depths plots.
